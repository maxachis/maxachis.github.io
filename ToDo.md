* Mobile: Possibly have smaller and more comprehensible collages/images than what you have on desktop. Watch you don't have to load too much.

### Hamburger and slide
* Clicking on burger to bring up slide, and then clicking directly on button (as opposed to elsewhere on screen) to remove slide causes burger to be slightly different icon shade. Clicking not on button fixes this.
* Should hamburger always be at top of screen even when scrolling?

### Nice-to-have
* Replace hamburger icon, accordion icon, and other things with custom icons, maybe using generative art or something that adds a bit more style.
* Do I want background to be basic white, or a slightly off-white or some other color to give an extra splash of personality?
* Slightly different color palettes, depending on the page? Just to add some variety.
* Add Alt-text to images
* Maybe make borders a little more faint than stark-black, or otherwise prettier. And if many of your borders are going to be the same style, consider finding a way to refactor them to more DRY code.

### General
* Change navigation so that people can get to every part of the website from a link, and not just via the root
