### About page
* Center content just below face and make content scrollable while keeping face static
* Maybe set profile pic as background for outer div.

### Projects Page
* Add more pics to MLCollage, using pics in ML project html file
* Add more pics to thesis collage, making things more grid-like to minimize white space between graphs
* Add border around outer div and thinner border around content div


### Skills Page
* Add padding to bottom of elements. React logo seems too close to bottom.
* Add slight coloration difference between accordion header and accordion body, so that it's easier for the user to differentiate
