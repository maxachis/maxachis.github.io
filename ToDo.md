### General
* A lot of stuff doesn't look good on mobile, including main page animation.

### Home
* Processing animation doesn't play well with hamburger menu. Either get rid of it on mobile, replace it with something more mobile-friendly, or get rid of it entirely.

### About page
* All good for now, chum

### Work page
* Mobile: Logos can clip on the smallest window sizes; make sure they shrink if window size gets too small

### Projects Page
* Add more pics to MLCollage, using pics in ML project html file
* Add more pics to thesis collage, making things more grid-like to minimize white space between graphs
* Add border around outer div
* Mobile: Tabs don't work on mobile. Replace with something else on mobile.
* Mobile: For each project have title, image, and then allow them to scroll down to read about it.
* Mobile: Possibly have smaller and more comprehensible collages/images than what you have on desktop. Watch you don't have to load too much.

### Skills Page
* Add padding to bottom of elements. React logo seems too close to bottom.
* Add slight coloration difference between accordion header and accordion body, so that it's easier for the user to differentiate
* Consider discussing your thoughts on each of the languages, including their comparative advantages and disadvantages (for example, how Python is good for an intro to coding but spoils you and sometimes has unintuitive interpreter behavior like the lists not copying themselves when passed as a parameter)

### Hamburger
* Clicking on burger to bring up slide, and then clicking directly on button (as opposed to elsewhere on screen) to remove slide causes burger to be slightly different icon shade. Clicking not on button fixes this.

### Nice-to-have
* Replace hamburger icon, accordion icon, and other things with custom icons, maybe using generative art or something that adds a bit more style.
