### About page

### Education page
* Height of container on non-mobile is a little too short. Give it less distance from the bottom.
* Mobile: Include where you got degree from? Probably in body instead of title.

### Projects Page
* Add more pics to MLCollage, using pics in ML project html file
* Add more pics to thesis collage, making things more grid-like to minimize white space between graphs
* Make all images same dimension (1200x800px)
* Sharpen some images in Portfolio website collage
* Mobile: Possibly have smaller and more comprehensible collages/images than what you have on desktop. Watch you don't have to load too much.
* Formatting runs into problems on iPad Air dimension

### Hamburger and slide
* Clicking on burger to bring up slide, and then clicking directly on button (as opposed to elsewhere on screen) to remove slide causes burger to be slightly different icon shade. Clicking not on button fixes this.

### Work page
* Possibly change header structure, especially for mobile -- if you have to choose, should you choose the date or the title?
* Consider shortening work summary quotes so they don't take up the entire screen on, for example, mobile

### Nice-to-have
* Replace hamburger icon, accordion icon, and other things with custom icons, maybe using generative art or something that adds a bit more style.
* Do I want background to be basic white, or a slightly off-white or some other color to give an extra splash of personality?
* Possible make background on sides of page include some of your illustrations (Clock Test-style or generative art)
* Slightly different color palettes, depending on the page? Just to add some variety.
* Add Alt-text to images
* Maybe make borders a little more faint than stark-black, or otherwise prettier. And if many of your borders are going to be the same style, consider finding a way to refactor them to more DRY code.
* Add a link to your Master's Thesis in Projects; possibly also the data, if that's appropriate.
* Make links more pretty-looking. Maybe give them a fancy font while retaining the blue highlight.
* Consider changing fonts or adding more font variety: Bodoni MT/72, Copperplate Gothic, Didot, Garamond, Helvetica, Impact, Playfair Display (Italics)
* If an image is dead, do not show the broken image icon
* A circle might look better for the animation, and do better with the vertical whitespace. Consider making it that.

### General
* Change navigation so that people can get to every part of the website from a link, and not just via the root
* Modify Accordion so that you can change the color of the associated elements without having to break your refactor (maybe pass classes as parameters?)
* Continue to modify images so that they load more quickly -- in some cases, like the hands, they are so small that they can easily be compressed. Maybe research how to improve (or at least conceal) image load time.

### Resume Page
* Use hover to indicate can click to other sections
* Add feature to slides/accordions on other pages such that specific parameters will load a specific slide/accordion
* Add "toPDF" feature?
